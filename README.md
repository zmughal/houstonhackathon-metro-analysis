Bus Stamp
===============================

An analysis of bus ridership demographics along Houston Metro routes.

Metro has recently created a smart phone app that gives people access to real time data. But what about all their riders without smart phones, and what if those riders make up the majority of their market?

Bus Stamp is looking to make a case for all the feature phone users that also want real time information.
